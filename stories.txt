project has no discription, clicking a title will reveal an overview of what the project is planning. basically step1 brings good descriptions to a project.
users are allowed to give a working title to a project, the most picked becomes the default title.

colabotating on a plan in 3 steps:
step 1: describing  # the 3 d's
step 2: drawing
step 3: detailing

by creating a project you have to create a document for it's first step (thereby giving it an initial description)
documents and their versions are owned by the user that created them
users are allowed to comment on documents, fork documents, or create new.
not-forking is an offence -- auto fork check, or even automated fork references based on symilarity of docs

subscribing and tagging are powerful tools (therefor maybe need a better name)
by subscribing a user can tag his subscriptions, by tagging he organizes his subscriptions, yet he also adds the tag to the object which allows others to find it. (tagging is a sort of decentralized/ad-hoc categorization, perfect for Tt)
tagging might need a way to clean things up a bit (investigate semantic tagging projects)
