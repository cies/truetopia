- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is a magic wrapper for the original Array#replace method. It serves for populating the paginated collection after initialization.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Why magic? Because it tries to guess the total number of entries judging by the size of given array. If it is shorter than <tt>per_page</tt> limit, then we know we're on the last page. This trick is very useful for avoiding unnecessary hits to the database to do the counting after we fetched the data for the current page.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: However, after using <tt>replace</tt> you should always test the value of <tt>total_entries</tt> and set it to a proper value if it's <tt>nil</tt>. See the example in <tt>create</tt>.
