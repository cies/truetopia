  text: Will Paginate view helpers
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Currently there is only one view helper: <tt>will_paginate</tt>. It renders the pagination links for the given collection. The helper itself is lightweight and serves only as a wrapper around link renderer instantiation; the renderer then does all the hard work of generating the HTML."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::H 
  level: 2
  text: Global options for helpers
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Options for pagination helpers are optional and get their default values from the WillPaginate::ViewHelpers.pagination_options hash. You can write to this hash to override default options on the global level:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  WillPaginate::ViewHelpers.pagination_options[:prev_label] = 'Previous page'\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: By putting this into your environment.rb you can easily translate link texts to previous and next pages, as well as override some other defaults to your liking.
